                                                 PLEASE READ THIS FIRST:-
Challenge:- identifying a site specific target that is not much present in all the body to target this disease specifically, validate the atrget.


IN CODE tab: 

1> File named as HTT_DNAJB1_TP53_MAPk8..... include all the necessay gene that can be the crucial target for this HD disease derieved from gene cards, omim, Disgenet database enrichment in string
and some other publications which i havent listed, more than 15K gene.

2>File named as first-enrichment-after-wgcna.png is the WGCNA result file after the analysis around top >200 genes png file : in BRANCHES you can see the tsv file for the WGCNA analysis result.
          IN BRANCHES i also include the wgcna data:
                        1) Heatmap
                        2) Volcano
                        3) Original csv file of result

3> top-enriched-targets.png repreent the even best targets sophisticated one having maximum score and some are identified as hub gene (by Gephi), this represent the combined WGCNA and other database
results combined givivng only the hub and the key linking factor connicting them to HTT which is CSNK2A1, CSNK2A2 genes.

From this 
         1> CSNK2A1
         2> CSNK2A2
       These gene represent the specific inetraction with the HTT linking the key CCT family, EEF family, and the major connecting family to all the HSPA4, HSPA8 one.



        Result:- among these the CSNK2A2 the alpha prime one is the one leading in case of specificity to HD disease.


SO:-
       
>NP_001887.1 CSNK2A2 [organism=Homo sapiens] [GeneID=1459]

Here this is the sequence of CSNK2A2 taken from the protein database of NCBI and odelled in SWISS-MODEL giving 99% identitiy to homo sapience with ramachandran plot in acceptance, no outliers here.
           CSnK2A2-SWISS-MODEL.PDB :- Represent the modellled structure.

Now i have done is make a specific molecule targetting it, that is being done, only thing remain is its stimulation that will be done shortly.



Here is summary of what is this HD disease:-

Huntington's Disease (HD) is a progressive, inherited brain disorder. It causes the gradual breakdown of nerve cells in the brain, which leads to worsening problems with movement, 
thinking, and behavior. There is currently no cure.

       Importance of the HTT Gene

            The HTT gene provides instructions for making a protein called huntingtin. In HD, a genetic mutation creates a faulty, longer version of this protein.

            This faulty huntingtin protein is toxic and accumulates in brain cells, causing them to malfunction and die. Essentially, the HTT gene mutation is the direct genetic cause of the disease.

            Therefore, the HTT gene and its protein product are the primary focus for developing therapies aimed at slowing or stopping the disease.







Thank you
